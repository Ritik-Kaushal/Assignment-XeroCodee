- This is a fundamental layout component for the web application. It serves as the overall structure that wraps the entire content of the application. This component is responsible for defining the core layout structure and includes components like `Navbar` and `Footer`. 

#### Component Structure
- Import statements for required modules and components:
  - [`Navbar`](#navbar) from '@/components/navbar'
  - [`Footer`](#footer) from '@/components/footer'

- The main content of the component:
  - The `RootLayout` component defines the basic layout structure for the web application. It wraps the entire content of the application.

- The layout structure consists of:

<!-- Docs of Landing Page -->
## Landing Page
#### Introduction
- This serves as the main landing page of the application. It is responsible for rendering various sections, including an introduction, client logos, features, testimonials, and a subscription form. The component provides a structured layout for showcasing essential content to the users.

#### Design Decisions
- **Component Composition**: The `Home` component is composed of several sub-components, each responsible for rendering a specific section of the landing page. This modular approach makes the codebase more maintainable and allows for easy customization of individual sections.

- **Section Order**: The sections are ordered logically to create a smooth user experience. It typically starts with an introduction, followed by client logos, features, testimonials, and ends with a subscription form, encouraging user engagement.

- **Reuse of Components**: The use of components like `Intro`, `Clients`, `Features`, `Testimonials`, and `Subscribe` promotes reusability and separation of concerns. Each of these components can be used independently in other parts of the application if needed.

- **Consistent Styling**: A consistent styling approach is applied across the sections to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface. This includes font choices, color schemes, and responsive design principles.

#### Challenges Faced
- **Responsive Design**: Achieving a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining a consistent user experience was a significant challenge. Various CSS classes were used to control visibility and layout across different devices.

- **Content Ordering**: Determining the optimal order of sections to create a compelling user journey required careful consideration and planning.

- **Styling Consistency**: Ensuring that styling remains consistent across all sections can be challenging, especially as the application evolves. Staying organized and using a style guide can help address this challenge.

#### Component Structure
- Import statements for required modules and components:
  - [`Intro`](#intro) from '@/components/intro'

<!-- Docs of Navbar -->
## Navbar
#### Introduction  
- The `Navbar` component is built such that it is responsive. It provides navigation links and a menu button for smaller screens. The component is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, adapting to both larger and smaller screens.

#### Design Decisions
- **Responsiveness**: The `Navbar` component is designed to be responsive, with different layouts and behavior for larger and smaller screens. It uses CSS classes like `xl:hidden` to control visibility and responsiveness.    
- **Off-Screen Navigation**: For smaller screens, an off-screen navigation menu is provided. Users can toggle the visibility of the menu by clicking the menu button (hamburger icon).
- **Navigation Links**: Navigation links are defined in the `navItems` array, making it easy to customize the links and their associated URLs.
- **Event Handling**: To close the off-screen menu when a user clicks outside of it, an event listener is added to the document. This event listener checks if the click is within the off-screen menu element (`offScreenRef`) and hides the menu if necessary.

#### Challenges Faced
- **Event Handling**: Ensuring that the off-screen navigation menu closes properly when a user clicks outside of it was a challenge. This required setting up a click event listener and properly checking if the click was within the menu element.
- **Responsive Design**: Achieving a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining a consistent user experience was a significant challenge. Various CSS classes were used to control visibility and layout.

#### Component Structure
The `Navbar` component is structured as follows:
- Import statements for required modules and components.
- Definition of the `NavItemInterface` interface for navigation items.
- Declaration of an array `navItems` to define the navigation links.
