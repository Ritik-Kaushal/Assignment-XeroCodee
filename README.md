## Navbar
#### Introduction  
- The `Navbar` component is built such that it is responsive. It provides navigation links and a menu button for smaller screens. The component is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, adapting to both larger and smaller screens.
#### Design Decisions
- **Responsiveness**: The `Navbar` component is designed to be responsive, with different layouts and behavior for larger and smaller screens. It uses CSS classes like `xl:hidden` to control visibility and responsiveness.    
- **Off-Screen Navigation**: For smaller screens, an off-screen navigation menu is provided. Users can toggle the visibility of the menu by clicking the menu button (hamburger icon).
- **Navigation Links**: Navigation links are defined in the `navItems` array, making it easy to customize the links and their associated URLs.
- **Event Handling**: To close the off-screen menu when a user clicks outside of it, an event listener is added to the document. This event listener checks if the click is within the off-screen menu element (`offScreenRef`) and hides the menu if necessary.
#### Challenges Faced
- **Event Handling**: Ensuring that the off-screen navigation menu closes properly when a user clicks outside of it was a challenge. This required setting up a click event listener and properly checking if the click was within the menu element.
- **Responsive Design**: Achieving a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining a consistent user experience was a significant challenge. Various CSS classes were used to control visibility and layout.
#### Component Structure
The `Navbar` component is structured as follows:
- Import statements for required modules and components.
- Definition of the `NavItemInterface` interface for navigation items.
- Declaration of an array `navItems` to define the navigation links.
- State management for controlling the visibility of the off-screen menu (`showNav`).
- Use of a ref (`offScreenRef`) to reference the off-screen navigation menu element for event handling.
